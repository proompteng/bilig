# Public APIs

## Current state

- `@bilig/core` now implements the documented range-mutation, undo/redo, selection, and sync-state surface.
- `SelectionState` is additive: existing callers can keep using `sheetName` and `address`, while newer callers can use `anchorAddress`, `range`, and `editMode`.
- `connectSyncClient` is live, but it is still an engine-side integration surface. The browser app is not worker-first yet, and the remote sync service is not the final durable backend.
- `@bilig/binary-protocol` is already a real wire protocol for sync frames, but the authoritative replicated workbook op family is still narrower than the full local engine surface.
- `@bilig/agent-api` is currently a binary envelope around JSON payloads, not yet a fully typed binary request/response/event schema.

## Stable packages

- `@bilig/core`
- `@bilig/formula`
- `@bilig/wasm-kernel`
- `@bilig/crdt`
- `@bilig/renderer`
- `@bilig/grid`
- `@bilig/binary-protocol`
- `@bilig/worker-transport`
- `@bilig/agent-api`
- `@bilig/storage-browser`
- `@bilig/storage-server`
- `@bilig/excel-fixtures`

## Workbook DSL

`@bilig/renderer` keeps the declarative workbook DSL unchanged:

- `<Workbook>`
- `<Sheet name="...">`
- `<Cell addr="..." value={...} />`
- `<Cell addr="..." formula="..." />`
- `<Cell addr="..." format="..." />`

## Core engine surface

The canonical engine surface includes:

- `createSheet`
- `deleteSheet`
- `setCellValue`
- `setCellFormula`
- `setCellFormat`
- `clearCell`
- `setRangeValues`
- `setRangeFormulas`
- `clearRange`
- `fillRange`
- `copyRange`
- `pasteRange`
- `setSelection`
- `undo`
- `redo`
- `getCell`
- `getDependencies`
- `getDependents`
- `explainCell`
- `exportSnapshot`
- `importSnapshot`
- `exportReplicaSnapshot`
- `importReplicaSnapshot`
- `applyRemoteBatch`
- `subscribe`
- `subscribeBatches`
- `connectSyncClient`
- `disconnectSyncClient`
- `getSyncState`

### Core types added in the current tranche

- `CellRangeRef`
- `SelectionRange`
- `SelectionEditMode`
- `SyncState`

## Binary protocol

`@bilig/binary-protocol` exposes:

- `PROTOCOL_VERSION`
- `encodeFrame(frame): Uint8Array`
- `decodeFrame(bytes): ProtocolFrame`

The current frame families are:

- `hello`
- `appendBatch`
- `ack`
- `snapshotChunk`
- `cursorWatermark`
- `heartbeat`
- `error`

The protocol surface is already real for sync and snapshot traffic. The remaining architecture gap is not “do we have binary frames?” but “does the authoritative workbook mutation language fully match what the local engine can represent?”

## Worker transport

`@bilig/worker-transport` exposes:

- `createWorkerEngineHost(engine, port)`
- `createWorkerEngineClient({ port })`

The first tranche already supports:

- method invocation
- engine events
- outbound batch subscriptions

## Target state

- the core API stays source-compatible while the worker-first runtime and durable backend land under it
- the binary protocol becomes the canonical wire format for browser sync, backend relay, and agent APIs
- the agent API moves from JSON payload bodies to typed binary request/response/event frames

## Exit gate

- every API documented here exists in code
- typecheck passes across all packages that import these APIs
- direct engine tests cover range mutation, history, selection state, and sync-state behavior
- the docs no longer claim a stable interface that is missing in the repo

## Agent API

`@bilig/agent-api` exposes:

- `AgentRequest`
- `AgentResponse`
- `AgentEvent`
- `encodeAgentFrame`
- `decodeAgentFrame`
- `encodeStdioMessage`
- `decodeStdioMessages`

Today the package defines typed TypeScript request/response/event unions, but the transport payload is still serialized with `JSON.stringify(...)` inside the binary frame envelope. The target state is a true typed binary schema shared by stdio and remote network usage.
